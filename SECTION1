*You are tasked in building a new product, an online restaurant reservation platform - 
hoose a front-end language/framework, back-end language/framework and a database management system. 
Tell us why youâ€™ve chosen this stack:*

## Answers:

Front-end: HTML, CSS, angular.js, Bootstrap
Back-end: ruby on rails
Database management system: MYSQL

## Explanations:

In order to develop the project with relevance to speed and convenience, using bootstrap framework can create responsive webs 
along with necessary HTML and CSS, the building blocks of a webpage and top it off with angular.js to extend HTML vocabulary 
to declare dynamic view in web-applications. For back-end, ruby on rails will be used as ruby is a relative simple object-oriented 
scripting language to learn and the main reason for ruby: rails, the framework where convention is highlighted, flexible to make 
changes to work and good testing framework. In terms of database management system, mySQL is selected as it is a common component 
for LAMP stack, as it is cost effective alternative compared to other software stacks, on top on it, MySQL is very much scalable, 
where it can be configured to adapt to a large set of conditions, hence the reservation system can be start small and grow later 
in size or performances. 

In addition, regarding hosting it would be suggested to use Google Cloud, as the client would not need to purchase or manage any 
hardware, it is low cost (pay per use) if the traffic is relatively low. CloudSQL also provides good database management where the 
programmers' work can be reduced.
